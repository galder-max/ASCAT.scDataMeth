# ASCAT.sc_data

R Data Package for [ASCAT.sc](https://github.com/VanLoo-lab/ASCAT.sc) containing pre-compiled panel of
normals and IDs of bad probes (bad loci) for 450K and Epicv1 Infinium
arrays.

There is now also support for Epicv2 - only following the google drive
link, as there are quotas for big files on the github LFS.

## Install

As the files are big, please download the package as a zip file [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zDu5-WEYq3OQ8qSZANBOMYTw-H-LNWTU?usp=share_link) and
install for R:

> R CMD build ASCAT.scDataMeth

> R CMD install ASCAT.scDataMeth_0.1.tar.gz
